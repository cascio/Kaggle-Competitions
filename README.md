# Kaggle Competition Submissions

An archival repository for Kaggle competition submissions created by [Michael Cascio](https://www.kaggle.com/cascio).

## Submissions
- [Ames, Iowa Housing Price Prediction Competition](https://github.com/cascio/Kaggle-Competitions/tree/master/Housing-Prices-Competition)

## Purpose
Record previous Kaggle competition submissions including original train and test csv files, personal jupyter notebooks containing exploratory data analysis, model training, validation, and prediction, and the submission csv final deliverable.

## How
The requirements.txt file shows all of the python packages installed in the virtual environment I use for data science. If you'd like to use my code, you can clone this repo and download the required packages. If you're new to Machine Learning in general, I found [Kaggle's Micro-Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) to be very informative.
