# Kaggle Competition Submissions

An archival repository for Kaggle competition submissions created by [Michael Cascio](https://www.kaggle.com/cascio).

## Submissions
- [Ames, Iowa Housing Price Prediction Competition](Housing-Prices-Competition/Ames%2C%20Iowa%20Home%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)
- [LANL Earthquake Prediction Competition](https://github.com/cascio/Kaggle-Competitions/tree/master/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction)

## Purpose
To record previous Kaggle competition submissions including original training and test csv files, jupyter notebooks containing exploratory data analysis, model training, validation, and prediction, and the final deliverable submission csv.

## How
The requirements.txt file shows all of the python packages installed in the virtual environment I use for data science. If you'd like to use my code, you can clone this repo and download the required packages. If you're new to Machine Learning in general, I found [Kaggle's Micro-Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview) to be very informative.
